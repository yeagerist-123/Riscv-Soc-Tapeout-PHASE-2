# Phase 2 – Total Chipout Verification

This repository contains my Phase-2 work for the total chipout flow using the Caravel SoC and SKY130 PDK.
It includes RTL and GLS simulations, netlist generation, waveform analysis, and verification steps required to ensure that the design behaves correctly before tapeout.
